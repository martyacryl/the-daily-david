# üìö Beginner's Guide to the Marriage Meeting Tool

## üéØ **What This Guide Is For**

This guide is designed for people who don't have a strong coding background but want to understand how the Marriage Meeting Tool works. Think of it as a "behind the scenes" tour of the app that explains what each part does in simple terms.

## üèóÔ∏è **How the App is Built (The Big Picture)**

### **Think of the App Like a House**
- **Frontend** = The rooms you see and use (like the living room, kitchen, bedroom)
- **Backend** = The plumbing, electrical, and foundation (hidden but essential)
- **Database** = The filing cabinet where all your information is stored
- **Documentation** = The instruction manuals for each part

### **The Three Main Parts**
1. **What You See** (Frontend) - The buttons, forms, and pages you interact with
2. **What You Don't See** (Backend) - The server that processes your requests
3. **Where Data Lives** (Database) - The storage system for all your information

## üìÅ **Documentation Areas Explained**

### **1. COMPONENT_REFERENCE.md - "The Parts List"**

#### **What It Is:**
This is like a catalog of all the different "parts" that make up the app. Just like a car has an engine, wheels, and seats, the app has different components.

- **Layout Components** = How things are arranged on the page
- **Feature Components** = The main functionality (weekly planning, goals, etc.)
- **State Management** = How the app remembers things
- **Data Layer** = How the app talks to the database

#### **How the App Uses It:**
- When you click a button, it's using a "Button component"
- When you see a form to enter your goals, it's using a "Goals component"
- When the app saves your data, it's using the "Data Layer"

#### **Real Example:**
When you're on the weekly planning page and you see:

## üîÑ **How All the Parts Work Together**

### **The Flow of Information:**
1. **You interact with the app** (click buttons, fill forms)
2. **Components handle your input** (using the Component Reference)
3. **Styling makes it look good** (using the Styling Guide)
4. **Data gets saved** (using the Backend and Database)
5. **Everything is deployed** (using the Deployment Guide)

### **Real-World Example:**
Let's say you want to add a new goal:

1. **You click "Add Goal"** ‚Üí The app uses a Button component
2. **A form appears** ‚Üí The app uses an Input component with styling
3. **You type your goal** ‚Üí The app follows the styling rules for forms
4. **You click "Save"** ‚Üí The app uses the data layer to save it
5. **The goal appears in your list** ‚Üí The app uses the goals component to display it

## üéØ **Key Concepts Explained Simply**

### **Frontend vs Backend**
- **Frontend** = What you see and click (like the steering wheel and dashboard in a car)
- **Backend** = What makes it work (like the engine and transmission)

### **Database**
- **Database** = A giant filing cabinet that stores all your information
- **Tables** = Different folders in the filing cabinet (users, goals, tasks, etc.)
- **Rows** = Individual pieces of information (like one specific goal)

### **Components**
- **Components** = Reusable building blocks (like LEGO pieces)
- **Props** = Instructions for how a component should behave
- **State** = What the component remembers about itself

### **API (Application Programming Interface)**
- **API** = The way the frontend talks to the backend
- **Endpoints** = Specific addresses where the frontend can ask for data
- **Requests** = Questions the frontend asks the backend
- **Responses** = Answers the backend gives back
